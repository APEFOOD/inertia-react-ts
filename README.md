## Laravel Inertia With Breeze, React and Typescript 

This starter template adds [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) support to a Laravel Breeze [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) ReactJS project. I will try to keep it up to date with whatever the current version of Laravel is at the time but hopefully I won't have to and the Laravel developers will graciously give us TypeScript support out of the box.  

## Getting Started 

To get started simply clone this repo and run:  

```
$ composer install
``` 
followed by: 
```
$ npm install 

# OR

yarn install 

# OR 

$ pnpm install  

```
## Learning Laravel
